quadratic:

    N = number of piecewise curves
    N * 2 = number of coordinates
    4 piecewise curves:
        P0 C0 P1 C1 P2 C2 P3 C3 P4
        P0 C0 P1
        P1 C1 P2
        P2 C2 P3
        P3 C3 P4

make streamlines_demo into a submodule of blog/streamlines

ensure no-nans for 0-length segments
    easiest to make a second pass through the data?
    also try going backwards in your test case
