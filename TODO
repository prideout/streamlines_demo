cubic:

    N = number of piecewise curves
    4 + (N - 1) * 2 = number of coordinates
    4 piecewise curves:
        P0 C0 C1 P1 C3 P2 C4 P3 C7 P4 
        curve 0: C0 C1 P0 P1
        curve 1: C2 C3 P1 P2, where C2 = reflection of C1 at P1
        curve 2: C4 C5 P2 P3, where C4 = reflection of C1 at P1
        curve 2: C6 C7 P3 P4, where C6 = reflection of C1 at P1

make streamlines_demo into a submodule of blog/streamlines

ensure no-nans for 0-length segments
    easiest to make a second pass through the data?
    also try going backwards in your test case
